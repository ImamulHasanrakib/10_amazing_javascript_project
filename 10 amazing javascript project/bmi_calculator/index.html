        <p>
          BMI, or body mass index, is a measure of body fat based on an
          individual's height and weight. It's a commonly used tool to determine
          if a person is underweight, within a healthy weight range, overweight,
          or obese. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in
          kilograms) by their height (in meters) squared.
        </p>
        <p>
          While BMI is a useful tool for assessing body fat, it's important to
          note that it has limitations. For example, it doesn't take into
          account the distribution of body fat or factors such as muscle mass,
          which can affect the accuracy of the measurement. Additionally, BMI
          may not be as accurate for certain groups of people, such as athletes
          or older adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its limitations, BMI can be a useful tool for providing a
          general idea of a person's weight status and health risk. If you're
          concerned about your BMI or overall health, it's important to consult
          with a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations and
          guidance.
